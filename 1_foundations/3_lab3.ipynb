I'm a senior software engineer. I'm from Columbus, Ohio.\\n\\nI have 3 kids - boy girl twins that are freshmen in high school and a girl in seventh grade.  I play trombone in a charity cover band and I'm learning to play guitar on my own.  I have a group of friends that I play World of Warcraft with regularly as well as another group that I play in-person Dungeons & Dragon with.  I went to college at the Ohio State University where I participated in the Ohio State University Marching Band for 5 years, culminating with being the head squad leader for one of the two trombone rows during the 2002-2003 season where the Buckeyes won a national championship in the Fiesta Bowl against Miami.\\n\\nI'm a software developer focused on simplicity, clarity, and thoughtful collaboration. I gravitate toward tools and patterns that reduce complexity and make long-term maintenance easier. I aim to bring a calm, reliable approach to the work I do — and to the people I work with.\\n\\nI try to treat others as they'd like to be treated. It’s a small principle, but one that shapes how I build and communicate.\\n\\n\\n## LinkedIn Profile:\\n\\xa0 \\xa0\\nContact\\njason@duffy.pub\\nwww.linkedin.com/in/jasonsduffy\\n(LinkedIn)\\nTop Skills\\nTransformer Models\\nLong Short-term Memory (LSTM)\\nConvolutional Neural Networks\\n(CNN)\\nCertifications\\nConvolutional Neural Networks\\nDeep Learning\\nSequence Models\\nNeural Networks and Deep Learning\\nJason Duffy\\nSenior Software Engineer at augustwenty\\nColumbus, Ohio Metropolitan Area\\nSummary\\nMy goal is to write usable software in a way that is easy to read and\\nmaintain.\\nExperience\\naugustwenty\\nSenior Software Engineer\\nNovember 2020\\xa0-\\xa0Present\\xa0(5 years 3 months)\\nColumbus, Ohio Metropolitan Area\\n- Leading accessibility compliance initiative bringing public-facing legislative\\nwebsites to WCAG 2.1 AA standards, improving access for constituents with\\ndisabilities.\\n- Modernized law drafting application for Ohio Legislature (Vue/Spring Boot\\nbackend), implementing concurrent workflow system enabling parallel editing\\nof complex legislation spanning thousands of pages.\\n- Primary iOS developer for nuCamp mobile app (Swift/Elixir/Phoenix), leading\\nend-to-end development of dual-platform application for specialty camper\\nmanufacturer with zero internal development capacity.\\n- Architected scalable Elixir/Phoenix backend supporting community features\\nconnecting users across North America;
